This is our group project in Software Engineering for Economists from the University of St.Gallen
We are Alina, Joao and Carla.
For our project, we phrased the following research question: What effect had the abandonment of the Swiss Franc - Euro parity of January 2015 on tourism within and outside of Switzerland? 

TODO
--------
- Documentation of our project progress in the Latex Doc 
- Create an own template for Latex? 
- Insert Dataset to Python 
- Create a new python model for calculations: necessary regressions for each variable;
- Module for graph plotting;
- In the end write a reflection section on Github, Latex and Python experience and overall coordination between members of the group;
- Don't forget to update frequently the documentation. 
- document the code 
- analyse the outputs of our regression 



GOAL
--------
This project aims to build an automated process to observe the effect of the exchange rate on some variables that the researcher chooses. The ideal objective is to verify if the trends calculated are in line with theory and then generate automatically those conclusions in a paper.
In this context it is created a model of simple linear regression comparisons to provide a fast overview of the events, but not an accurate one. 
The plan to accomplish this is divided in three parts: dataset automation, calculations and paper. Their description will follow in the next sections. 




DATASET AUTOMATION
--------
The researcher has to be able to download the data she wants and a python module will merge and create a unique file that will be used in the calculation modules. 
In this project a version with tourism data and the exchange rate will be used, but the ultimate goal is that the research is able to add any data files she wants. The automation enables a fast and easy procedure of replicate and test new relationships within the same module. 




CALCULATIONS
--------
Depending on the number of variables chosen by the researcher, it will be possible to create all the simple regressions with the minimum number of tweaks.




PAPER
--------
This last section is considered to be more difficult to automate given the different conclusions resulting from different results. To accomplish the objective in this last section, it is proposed an approach using conditional options to present the values and create the necessary conclusions. 

--------


This project pretends to propose a framework following the red button theory. A simple model is used to show the far automation can be taken by the researcher and motivate experts to apply the same theory to more complex models and projects.
